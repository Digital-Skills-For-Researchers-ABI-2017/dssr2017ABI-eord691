**Digital Skills** 

The project runs a reconstruction of the intracavity electrical field of the heart based on known electrograms on the endocardial surface. It utilises forward solution to construct the **potential and activation map**. Several solution points inside the atrial surface are to be identified. These points will be used to design the location of electrodes needed for the design of an **_intracardiac catheter_**.
