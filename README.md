The project runs a reconstruction of the electrical signals of the heart using measured data from the endocardial surface. 
It utilises forward solution to construct the **potential and activation map**. 
Several solution points inside the atrial surface are to be identified. These points will be used to design the location of
electrodes needed for the design of an **_intracardiac catheter_**.
