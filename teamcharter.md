1. **Project Name:** **_Design, Modelling and Fabrication of Intracardiac Catheter for AF Diagnosis_**
2. **Vision:** To reconstruct a 3D model of the electrical mapping of the atria using measured data from the endocardial surface
3. **Mission:** The 3D model of the atria will be in the form of potential and activation maps. The maps will be constructed by using forward solution to obtain the necessary spatiotemporal signals 
4. **Success Criteria:**
     1. Create an algorithm that will define the computational requirements
     2. Create a script file that runs a forward solution 
     3. Produce activation and potential maps with the lowest possible error
5. **Team Agreement:**
     1. Behaviour Agreement
         * Patience in creating the script file
     2. Communication Agreement
         * Immediate feedback on possible changes
6. **Project Team:**
     * Emma Ordono - PhD Student
     * David Budgett - Main Supervisor
     * Bruce Smaill - Co Supervisor
